It is the gluten in wheat flour that is responsible for the unique features of bread, which are not possible with other cereal flours. Vital Wheat Gluten is a concentrated protein that possesses a special visco-elastic property. As a functional protein, vital wheat gluten provides additional qualities to the dough when used in baked goods. Wheat flour contains some natural gluten but often not to the extent desired. Many baked goods benefit from the addition of vital wheat gluten. The effect on the bread is remarkable.

On that lush Caribbean island, with its warm tropical breezes and fertile soil, the brothers planted coffee trees on their farm and called it Hacienda Buenos Aires. It was there that our familys patriarch, Don Francisco Gavia, was born. As a boy, he watched his father till the soil, plant seedlings, tend the trees and make sure that only the ripest and most flavorful coffee cherries were handpicked.

Blending a reverence of plants with the wisdom of the ancient arts, Traditional Medicinals combine the best of herbal medicine with the most modern scientific methods of quality control to produce a line of traditional herbal tea formulas distributed across the country.<P> It all started in early 1974, when three young friends started Traditional Medicinals in the back store room of a small herb shop along the Russian River in Northern California. The company was founded with the intention of providing healing remedies, while preserving the knowledge and herbal formulas of Traditional Herbal Medicine, or THM. At the time, traditional herbal tea infusions, likely the earliest form of medicine, had all but faded away here in this country. And never before had these safe and effective medicines been available in convenient tea bags. Over the decades that followed, the company introduced millions of health conscious consumers to traditional herbal tea formulas and the concepts of THM. These effective natural medicines were well received and Traditional Medicinals has grown dramatically. Well over a billion cups of tea have been produced at the company's California facility, and many products such as Smooth Move, Throat Coat, and Organic Echinacea Plus have become mainstream and can readily be found throughout North America.<P>"", 'If pregnant or breast-feeding, ask a health professional before use.', 'Proprietary Blend: 1, 500 mg Organic green tea leaf (Camellia sinensis) [PhFr]*, Organic West Indian lemongrass leaf (Cymbopogon citratus), Organic lemon myrtle leaf (Backhousia citriodora)', 'Brew Well to be Well&#0174; For maximum benefit, tea must be properly prepared.

These were some of the first available gluten-free foods. In her youth, she had one of the few ""female"" jobs in the bakery as a cookie packer. Even as a child, and then as a bakery employee, ""I was continually amazed that dedicated customers were so thankful to find our gluten-free foods.

The typical reply was, \'Let them be happy there is something on the market for them to eat,\'"" she says.', 'Always the dessert baker at home, and after all those hours on the cookie line in the family business, she started experimenting with wheat-free baking. The challenge was to make products that tasted so good that no one would be able to tell that they were wheat-free. ""My career was born,"" she says. ""In 1988, I left the family business taking one small pallet of my belongings with my first forklift and moved two blocks away.""

Whether you love PLANTERS Peanuts for their delicious peanut taste or their satisfying crunch, theres a variety just for you. All about the Peanut Although its name implies it is a nut, peanuts are not true nuts but, instead, a member of a family of legumes related to peas, lentils, chickpeas and other beans. Peanuts start growing as a flower, but, because of their heavy weight after pollination, they bend toward and eventually go underground where the peanut matures. Although peanuts come in many varieties, there are four main types with specific size, taste and nutrient make-up; they include Runners, Virginia, Spanish and Valencia. Runners have become extremely popular because of their high yield. More than half of these peanuts are used for peanut butter. Virginias have the largest kernels and are typically the peanuts you find roasted in the shell or in snack bags. Spanish-type peanuts have smaller kernels and higher oil content than other types of peanuts and are covered with a reddish-brown skin. They are used mostly in peanut candies, some snack nuts and peanut butter. Valencias are a very sweet ""nut"" with three or more small kernels to a pod and are covered in a bright-red skin. They are usually roasted or boiled and sold in-the-shell. So many nuts, so little time. In the mood for something simple?

Fiber - Peanuts are a good source of dietary fiber, which can help keep you feeling full longer and can aid digestion. Not too many snacks contain fiber! Niacin is a B vitamin that the body uses to convert food into energy. A oneounce serving of peanuts delivers about 15% of the niacin you need each day. Vitamin E - A oneounce serving of peanuts delivers a good source of Vitamin E, an antioxidant that helps you protect cells from damage. Resveratrol - This plant compound with antioxidant properties is found in peanuts (especially high in peanut skins) as well as grapes. Many scientific studies are looking at its health benefits. Good Fats - Experts recommend limiting the intake of foods high in saturated fat and replacing them with foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturatedgoodfats.

The Austrian-born Puck began his formal training at age 14, inspired by his mother, Maria, a hotel chef. Encouraged by a friend, Wolfgang left Europe in 1973 at the age of 24, having already learned his craft as a classically trained French chef in the master kitchens of three-star French restaurants: the Hotel de Paris in Monaco, Maxim\'s in Paris, and L\'Oustau de Baumaniere in Provence. After spending two years as chef at the restaurant La Tour in Indianapolis, Puck moved to Los Angeles and became both chef and part owner of Ma Maison, which quickly became a magnet for the rich and famous. <P> After the 1981 publication of his first cookbook, <i>Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen</i>, based on his popular recipes at Ma Maison, Spago, located in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip, was an instant success and culinary phenomenon from its opening day in 1982. His first signature dishes--such as ""gourmet"" pizzas topped with smoked salmon and caviar and Sonoma baby lamb with braised greens and rosemary--put him and Spago on the Los Angeles foodie map. Over its popular 18 years, the original location of Spago earned many accolades, including the prestigious Restaurant of the Year award by the James Beard Foundation in 1994.', 'Over a span of 20 years, an empire of Wolfgang Puck dining establishments has opened, including fine dining restaurants in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Palo Alto, and Maui and casual dining and quick service restaurants in nationwide urban centers, airports, and supermarkets.

"['Wholesome Organic Blue Agave is a 100% pure natural low glycemic sweetener harvested from the core of the Blue Agave plant. Organic Blue Agave is ideal for sweetening beverages like coffee and lemonade, or for topping oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, cereal and more. It is also great in smoothies, iced tea, or cocktails as it dissolves quickly in cold beverages. Agave is easy to bake with as well. Try it wherever you would use sugar. Blue Agave has a Low Glycemic Index (GI), so it is slowly absorbed into the body, preventing spikes in blood sugar. It is 1-1/4 times sweeter than sugar, so you can use less to achieve your perfect level of sweetness.

"['De Cecco gently grinds the heart of each grain, mixes it with cold spring water, then kneads the dough slowly. This results in pasta with the exceptional de Cecco aroma, flavor, and consistency. Pasta easily cooks to perfection, has a great firm texture, and a delicious fresh pasta taste. It has a rougher surface, which helps the sauce stick to it. Since 1886 we have liked our pasta to be bronze drawn and slowly dried because we like it to fall into the plate full of taste, rough and always ""al dente"". Even though our taste has not changed, as we feel the same love for tradition, we have continued to improve our production technologies. Make de Cecco pasta the secret ingredient for your most amazing dishes.Buon Appetito! Rigatoni, which is a typical type of traditional pasta from Rome, have the characteristic ridged external surface and a large diameter and thickness.

"[""The 150 year Ortega tradition all started with Maria Conception Jacinta Dominguez Ortega, or as we like to call her, Mama. Mama Ortega. Mama's memorable cooking did more than just bring her family together. It was in Mama's kitchen that her 11th child, Emilio, established the Ortega Chile Packing Company. Emilio's fascination with chiles began when he moved to New Mexico in 1890. Here he encountered the state's popular big red chiles. When he returned home to California a few years later, he brought with him chile pepper seeds and many recipes for dishes he had grown to love while in New Mexico. Back home with his family at their adobe house in Ventura, California, Emilio planted the chile seeds. Those chiles grew extremely well in the temperature climate of Ventura. Soon Emilio had so many chiles he had to give them away. Everyone loved them! That's when he knew he had something special. In 2003, B&G Foods purchased the Ortega brand. Like Emilio Ortega, B&G Foods has a long tradition of commitment to quality. So today, when a family picks up a can of chiles or a box of taco shells, they know they are getting the very best. This web site has been created to continue the rich heritage of the Ortega family.

And it\'s time you met the real great chef behind this real great food. The Chef Boyardee brand is named after its founder, Hector Boiardi. Born in Italy in 1897, Boiardi immigrated to the U.S. in 1914, and followed his brother to the kitchen of The Plaza Hotel in New York City, where he quickly worked his way up to head chef. In 1924, Boiardi opened the Il Giardino d\'Italia (The Garden of Italy) restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio. It was a smash, and when customers began asking him for his recipes and ingredients, he got the idea to sell his culinary creations. Thus, an empire was born. Chef Hector opened a factory in 1928. He introduced his products to America a year later, touting his now-famous spaghetti dinner as a delicious and economical choice to serve to the entire family. Proud of his Italian heritage, Boiardi sold his products under the brand name ""Chef Boy-Ar-Dee"" so that his American customers could pronounce it properly. ABOUT CONAGRA Chef Boyardee is a member of the ConAgra Foods family, one of the largest packaged foods companies in North America with major presence in retail outlets, foodservice and restaurants, and in ingredients.

This quality of MCT has been shown to offer benefits depending on the health situation. Unlike LCT, MCT do not require the intestinal lymphatic system or bile salts for absorption, and hence they are referred to as ""quick fuel.""', 'For this reason, MCT are often given to people who have difficulty absorbing conventional long chain fatty acids. MCT do not contain essential fatty acids, and therefore they are normally only substituted for up to 50-70 percent of dietary fat. However, some evidence suggests that the absorption of long chain triglycerides may be improved if combined with MCT. MCT are metabolized primarily in the liver. The safety of MCT consumption in humans is not a concern, as several clinical trials have shown no adverse effect from levels of 1 gram per kilogram of body weight per day.', 'We owe a portion of our understanding of the effects of MCT on the heart to the citizens of Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, a significant amount of dietary fat consists of MCT from coconut oil, and data indicate that the citizens of Sri Lanka score particularly high in the area of heart-health. This realization led nutritional and medical researchers to look at the effects of coconut oil MCT in more depth.', 'Feeding MCT to rats resulted in animals with lower body weights, a smaller amount of fat deposits and excellent survival rates.* Maintenance of a healthy body weight supports heart and artery function as we age. MCT consumption is also associated with healthy levels of serum and liver cholesterol within a normal range.* Furthermore, in a double-blind study, 1.7 g of MCT daily at breakfast significantly promoted healthy cholesterol levels within a normal range compared to that of the LCT group at 8 weeks.* Other studies have shown positive effects on triglycerides, within a normal range.*', 'MCT have physical and metabolic properties that are distinct from those of long-chain fatty acids, making them a readily available cellular energy source.* These properties have been used advantageously in clinics for more than 50 years in people who are either undernourished or possess lipid absorption and long-chain fatty acid oxidation defects. In this latter contingent, nutritional interventions with MCT have been shown to promote healthy heart function.* Current research supports the notion that suboptimal heart function is associated with heart-energy deficiency, and that MCT can be helpful in providing support.*', 'Some research suggests that MCT may support metabolic rate and energy expenditures in the body when substituted in the diet for other types of fat.* MCT may induce satiety, leading to decreased consumption of calories.* Increased metabolic rate and decreased caloric intake may lead to a decrease in body fat. MCT contain 6 to 8.5 kcal per gram.', 'In one study conducted in a group of 40 subjects, randomized into 2 test groups, MCT or corn oil was administered as part of daily food intake for 90 days. The MCT group showed a significant reduction in body weight. In a double-blind crossover study, subjects were asked to keep their usual lifestyle, including diet and physical activity while consuming MCT as part of their diet. The results indicated that body fat mass was significantly lower after 3 weeks when consuming MCT compared to soybean oil.

"[""The crispness and flavor reflect the finest, all natural ingredients that go into Walkers Shortbread - creamery butter, best flour, sugar and salt. No flavorings, artificial colorings or additives. All guaranteed. Petticoat Tail cookies break into 6 individual triangles. The shortbread pure butter shortbread cookies are all made in the Highlands of Scotland to the Walker's family traditional shortbread recipe."", 'BRAND STORY <b></b>', 'The Walkers story begins over a hundred years ago in 1898 in the Scottish Highlands, when the twenty-one year old Joseph Walker opened the doors of his own bakery with a loan of 50 and the dream of making the finest shortbread in the world. In the first year of business, Joseph used every spare moment to perfect his shortbread recipe, and it was time well spent.', 'As his fame spread, and demand increased for his quality shortbread, Joseph took the first steps to expanding the business by moving to a larger shop in the Speyside village of Aberlour and investing in a horse and cart to deliver his baking further afield.', ""During the 30s, the business - like Joseph's family - was expanding. Two of his sons - James and Joseph - joined the business, bringing fresh, new ideas with them. By 1936, they had introduced three valuable additions to the business: a range of cakes, a selection of confectionery - and the company's first delivery van. Now Walkers produce could be sold even further afield, and the prospects for expansion were looking promising."", ""While some manufacturers began to cut corners by using margarine instead of butter, Joseph believed that people still appreciated the care that went into making a superior product like Walkers shortbread. And he was right. That's why, even after Joseph Walker died in 1954, his sons continued to use his original recipe."", ""Demand grew, and so did the business. By 1961, all three of James' children - Joseph, James and Marjorie - had joined the business, making the third generation of Walkers working for the family firm. By 1975, Walkers had outgrown their extended bakery, and moved to a custom built factory that gave them the extra space and facilities they needed to develop new products such as Chocolate Chip Shortbread and specialty cookies."", ""By the 1970s, Joseph's grandchildren had begun exporting Walkers shortbread to over 60 countries around the world - still baking to his original recipe. Within a decade, they won the first of three Queen's Awards for Export Achievement - the highest accolade given to British exporters."", ""Then, as now, Walkers stayed in touch with their customers by testing every new product in Aberlour's village shop. So, customers around the world are enjoying a range of products that were first given the seal of approval by the villagers of Aberlour. Consistent quality and traditionally delicious recipes have made Walkers the choice of the most discerning customers and retailers."", ""Walkers reputation grows day by day as loyal customers worldwide delight in traditional shortbreads and innovative new products like almond, ginger and luxurious chocolate covered shortbread. All Walkers' products are packaged in its unmistakable red tartan and proudly bearing the image of Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora MacDonald, the image which captures one of the most romantic moments from Scotlands history, and reflects all the tradition and care that goes into baking every piece of Walkers shortbread."", 'The quality and natural goodness of Walkers has attracted many international awards, including five gold Mondiale medals and the Food from Britain Innovation Award.', ""While Joseph's children and grandchildren have moved with the times, they have always remained true to his original ideal - and his original recipe. So, when the family opened a new factory at Elgin to produce their popular new range of shortbread cookies and biscuits, they naturally still insisted on using only the finest ingredients: plump fruits, aromatic spices, chunks of real chocolate and flavorsome nuts. And there's not an artificial flavoring, coloring or preservative in sight. Just as Joseph Walker guaranteed all those years ago."", ""Today, Joseph would be proud to know that his great grandchildren are carrying on the family tradition and are now the fourth generation of Walkers to make 'The world's classic pure butter shortbread'."", 'Contains: milk, wheat, gluten.

way to take the sugar out of the fruit without adding artificial sweetners.<br><b>Q: Why is it called The Switch?</b> A: Because The Switch offers a healthier alternative to soda.<br><b>Q: Why is the ""THE"" upside down?</b> A: Sorry, that is classified information. But please tell Switch why YOU think it is upside down--check out the website--the best answer can win some cool prizes.<br><b>Q: Who invented The Switch?</b> A: Health enthusiast, Mike Gilbert, regularly drank orange mixed with sparkling water to replace the vital hydration and nutrients he lost during his work out. One day sitting in the parking lot of his gym, mixing his juice and sparkling water, he spilled it all over his lap. Why, he wondered did he have to go through this ritual everyday? Why doesn\'t anyone make a carbonated 100% juice?

"['HealthWise Gourmet Coffees use Colombian Arabica Supremo beans exclusively, one of the highest grades of coffee beans available. The company roasts coffee in small batches to ensure quality and consistency. The TechnoRoasting process eliminates acids and irritants, which helps all who suffer from heartburn or stomach conditions exacerbated by acid. Instead of compromising flavor, the process also reduces bitterness and harshness common to other coffee products, which leaves a rich and mellow taste. The same process also protects the original minerals and micro-nutrients from coffee beans that many health-care products leverage. This contrasts with the roasting processes most often used by others, which typically destroys the compounds within coffee beans that offer many health benefits. An additional benefit of this process allows a pot to remain on a burner for hours without becoming increasingly bitter, a common consequence of other roasting methods. Similarly, you can refrigerate HealthWise coffee for up to one week, reheat it to below boiling, and the tast will remain unchanged from the original brewed cup. The total yield from a 12-ounce can, 110 cups, exceeds other brands as well since you do not have to use as many beans to make a full-flavored cup or pot.', 'This product is labelled to United States standards and may differ from similar products sold elsewhere in its ingredients, labeling and allergen warnings', 'Use less HealthWise ground coffee than other coffees and obtain the same coffee strength.

"[""When Dr. Lucy Gibney learned her child had severe food allergies, she got down to some serious medical research in the kitchen. Inspired by her son and encouraged by her husband, she put aside her career as an emergency physician to create great tasting foods for people with modified diets. She started by taking her mothers time tested recipes and substituted her own gluten free flour blend. Next she meticulously experimented until she baked great tasting cookies without milk, butter or eggs. Most importantly, she knew the only way to make products in a protected environment and prevent unwanted ingredients such as peanuts or tree nuts was to control the process from start to finish. She has put all of her efforts into creating a dedicated bakery where her vision is now a reality. Today, Lucy's cookies stand as proof that no one ever has to be denied a good cookie. Every crispy, crunchy Lucy's cookie is baked without wheat, gluten, milk, eggs, peanuts or tree nuts. But you'd never know it. They taste delicious. Today, Dr. Lucy continues to advocate for people with food allergies and special diets. Her vision unfolds daily with increasing demand for her yummy cookies and enthusiastic support from dedicated customers. Made from natural ingredients using no preservatives or trans-fat, and high quality ingredients are used in a carefully controlled bakery to be sure the products meet tight allergen testing criteria.

Just naturally delicious ingredients.', 'BRAND STORY <b></b>', 'The Walkers story begins over a hundred years ago in 1898 in the Scottish Highlands, when the twenty-one year old Joseph Walker opened the doors of his own bakery with a loan of &pound;50 and the dream of making the finest shortbread in the world. In the first year of business, Joseph used every spare moment to perfect his shortbread recipe, and it was time well spent.', 'As his fame spread, and demand increased for his quality shortbread, Joseph took the first steps to expanding the business by moving to a larger shop in the Speyside village of Aberlour and investing in a horse and cart to deliver his baking further afield.', ""During the 30s, the business - like Joseph's family - was expanding. Two of his sons - James and Joseph - joined the business, bringing fresh, new ideas with them. By 1936, they had introduced three valuable additions to the business: a range of cakes, a selection of confectionery - and the company's first delivery van. Now Walkers produce could be sold even further afield, and the prospects for expansion were looking promising."", ""While some manufacturers began to cut corners by using margarine instead of butter, Joseph believed that people still appreciated the care that went into making a superior product like Walkers shortbread. And he was right. That's why, even after Joseph Walker died in 1954, his sons continued to use his original recipe."", ""Demand grew, and so did the business. By 1961, all three of James' children - Joseph, James and Marjorie - had joined the business, making the third generation of Walkers working for the family firm. By 1975, Walkers had outgrown their extended bakery, and moved to a custom built factory that gave them the extra space and facilities they needed to develop new products such as Chocolate Chip Shortbread and specialty cookies."", ""By the 1970s, Joseph's grandchildren had begun exporting Walkers shortbread to over 60 countries around the world - still baking to his original recipe. Within a decade, they won the first of three Queen's Awards for Export Achievement - the highest accolade given to British exporters."", ""Then, as now, Walkers stayed in touch with their customers by testing every new product in Aberlour's village shop. So, customers around the world are enjoying a range of products that were first given the seal of approval by the villagers of Aberlour. Consistent quality and traditionally delicious recipes have made Walkers the choice of the most discerning customers and retailers."", ""Walkers reputation grows day by day as loyal customers worldwide delight in traditional shortbreads and innovative new products like almond, ginger and luxurious chocolate covered shortbread. All Walkers' products are packaged in its unmistakable red tartan and proudly bearing the image of Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora MacDonald, the image which captures one of the most romantic moments from Scotland&rsquo;s history, and reflects all the tradition and care that goes into baking every piece of Walkers shortbread."", 'The quality and natural goodness of Walkers has attracted many international awards, including five gold Mondiale medals and the Food from Britain Innovation Award.', ""While Joseph's children and grandchildren have moved with the times, they have always remained true to his original ideal - and his original recipe. So, when the family opened a new factory at Elgin to produce their popular new range of shortbread cookies and biscuits, they naturally still insisted on using only the finest ingredients: plump fruits, aromatic spices, chunks of real chocolate and flavorsome nuts. And there's not an artificial flavoring, coloring or preservative in sight.

"['Great River Organic Milling is located on the upper Mississippi River, in the heart of what is called the Hiawatha Valley. The natural beauty of the area is a constant reminder of the importance of our commitment to organic agriculture. Organic, or sustainable agriculture is more than the avoidance of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. An organic farm strives to protect our environment by building and maintaining healthy soil which, in turn, improves water and air quality. It has been shown that grain and other food crops grown in a healthy soil, resist pests and diseases better than conventionally grown crops and also contain more vital nutrients important to humans. Consuming organic foods promotes the health of individuals and the land on which it was grown. In supporting organic agriculture we promote the cycle of a healthy environment which includes the lives of microorganisms, plants, and humans. Most Great River flour is stone-ground. We believe the natural granite millstones contribute to the quality, taste and nutritional integrity of whole grain flour. Grain flowing into the stones becomes very thin, flat flakes which integrates all parts of the wheat immediately into the flour, allowing the flour to have more flavor. The cooler temperatures that occur during milling with stones allows important enzyme activity to continue. Protein levels are also be maintained. Our stone-ground flours are milled to order, to retain the nutritional value of the flour. Great River is Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International and Kosher approved. Obtaining our certification requires a yearly inspection of our milling facility and records to insure that our products meet industry standards.', 'Organic Hard Red Spring Wheat', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']","Great River Organic Milling Organic Whole Grains Hard Red Spring Wheat, 25-pounds (Pack of1)","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3195DN3KGdL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pOXMlgrOL._SS40_.jpg']",Great River Organic Milling,41.55,B0049YK20Q

Granted DOP status in 1986, Calasparra is still, to this day, the only such protected rice in the European community.

Our beans are traditionally cured over several months to ensure that the full flavor of the vanilla bean is developed. We do not sell quick cured vanilla beans where the beans are cured in 7 to 10 days. These vanilla beans are triple inspected.

Bourbon alcohol is not used in vanilla beans. - Vanilla beans are the second most labor intensive spice after saffron. - They originated in Mexico. - Vanilla beans must be hand pollinated outside of Mexico because the pollinator, the Melipona bee, cannot survive outside of Mexico. - When the vanilla orchid blooms, it must be pollinated with 24 hours or else the boom dies and no vanilla pod is produced for that bloom. - Vanilla is an orchid, and the beans are the fruit of the orchid. - It is the only orchid fruit that we eat. - There are over 200 organic compounds in vanilla.

"[""La Tourangelle Toasted Sesame oil is pure, all-natural and handcrafted from high-quality sesame seeds harvested from South America or Africa. The seeds are toasted and then expeller (machine) pressed to extract the oil. This oil is filtered several times and then bottled. Our mill slowly roasts the sesame seeds using lower temperatures. The result is a deep amber, richly flavored oil with a subtle toasted taste. Sesame Oil has long been the universal cooking medium in Asia, imparting the characteristic flavor to the foods of its regions. In Chinese and Korean cuisine, it is added as a flavor highlight to cooked dishes. The Japanese often add about 10% toasted Sesame Oil to the oil used for tempura or deep-frying, creating a rich, background flavor. American cooks may want to use Sesame Oil to flavor an Asian stir-fry or noodle dish or as a marinade for meat or fish. Sesame Oil, rice vinegar, fresh grated ginger, and mustard is a delicious dressing for any combination of salad greens. Sesame Oil, is an ancient ingredient. The Assyrians used it as a cooking oil more than 600 years before Christ. It was expensive, however, and a hundred years later in Persia only the rich could afford it. It is still used as a medicine in India , and oil pressed from the raw seed is a massage oil in Ayurvedic medicine. Its low saturated fatty acid content and high unsaturated fatty acid content makes it a very healthy oil. La Tourangelle is one of few remaining oil mills keeping a time-honored French heritage of roasting and pressing nut kernels into delicious oils. We are a family-owned company whose mastery of oil production is the fruit of passion, integrity, and pride.

"[""Rich in flavor. Subtle, yet complex. Just a few words that have been describing Cameron's coffee since 1978. What can we say? It's all in the bean. After seeking out the world's finest plantations, we select only the highest flavor-quality Arabica beans. These beans are typically grown at a high altitude, usually 4,000-5,000 feet above sea level. The higher altitude makes the coffee cherry mature slower and stay on the tree longer, resulting in a coffee bean that is more dense, less acidic, and has naturally lower levels of caffeine. Then, we carefully blend and roast them in small batches and rush them fresh to you. Is it worth the effort? Taste for yourself.

"['The Puroast story begins while Im sitting on a Venezuelan coffee farm one morning and Im served a cup of coffee by my host. The same fellow who grew, roasted and brewed the beans. The taste was unlike any coffee I had ever had. Savory, rich and very smooth. No bitterness. I assumed this great taste was because I was on a coffee farm, like drinking wine in a vineyard. It turns out the secret to this flavor was how heat was used in roasting. I knew then that I wanted to learn how to create a coffee that is pure to the art of roasting. Puroast Coffee. After a long journey, we found the right flavor and Puroast Coffee was born. So my brother and I start selling Puroast in local stores in California, people loved the taste and then we find out theres a lot more to the story. Mixed in with the compliments about taste, we received comments telling us Puroast Coffee didnt upset customers stomachs or aggravate their heartburn. There were so many of these comments that we decided to find out if there was something different about Puroast which would be a significant benefit. We discovered there was a big difference in Puroast. Not only does our roasting recipe make for a smoother taste, it also greatly reduces the acid in the coffee by more than 70% compared to leading brands. 70% less acid than other coffees! This isnt just me saying this, its Dr. Shibamoto and scientific research team from the University of California/Davis. Dr. Shibamoto found that in reducing acid levels, our roasting process dramatically increased the amount of antioxidants. And by dramatic I mean by 5 times more than other leading coffees and 7 times more than green tea. 7 times more antioxidants than green tea! You will discover what I did on that Venezuelan coffee farm, along with Puroast Coffees exquisite flavor, the benefits of lower acid and rich levels of antioxidants will bring you enjoyment like no other coffee youve ever had.', 'This product is labelled to United States standards and may differ from similar products sold elsewhere in its ingredients, labeling and allergen warnings', '100% Coffee', 'To make the perfect cup of Puroast Coffee use cold water, use 2.5 ounces of Puroast Coffee for a good 10-12 cup pot (or find your own perfect amount).

Spice description turmeric is the rhizome or underground stem of a ginger-like plant. It is usually available ground, as a bright yellow, fine powder. The whole turmeric is a tuberous rhizome, with a rough, segmented skin. The rhizome is yellowish-brown with a dull orange interior that looks bright yellow when powdered. Bouquet: earthy and slightly acrid. Flavor: warm and aromatic with a bitter undertone. Preparation and storage turmeric is mostly used in ground form. The powder will maintain its coloring properties indefinitely though the flavor will diminish over time so buy in moderation. Store in airtight containers, out of sunlight. Culinary uses : in India it is used to tint many sweet dishes. Apart from its wide use in Moroccan cuisine to spice meat, particularly lamb, and vegetables, its principal place is in curries and curry powders. It is used in many fish curries, possibly because it successfully masks fishy odors. When used in curry powders, it is usually one of the main ingredients, providing the associated yellow color. Attributed medicinal properties turmeric is a mild digestive, being aromatic, a stimulant and a carminative. An ointment base on the spice is used as an antiseptic .

"[""<b>About Terrasoul Superfoods Organic Vanilla Bean Powder:</b> Our raw vanilla bean powder is made from 100% pure, organic, fresh ground vanilla beans and contains no preservatives or fillers. Our vanilla bean powder is made by grinding the whole vanilla pod and then sifting out some of the pod material from the seeds. This process helps to bring out the natural oils and flavor of the vanilla beans. Use in the place of extracts for a pure vanilla flavor. \n<br> \n<br> \n<b>Key Nutrition Benefits of Terrasoul Superfoods Organic Vanilla Bean Powder:</b> \n<br> Vanilla Bean contains many trace minerals such like potassium, iron, manganese and copper.

"[""Like you, we were looking for an alternative to sugar. Cane syrup, barley malt syrup, stevia, sorbitol. Over the years we tried them all, and some of the nasty ones too. We'd find a product, use it for a while, then be surprised by the latest, high-publicity health scare. Sounds familiar, you might be saying. We tried those natural sweeteners such as brown rice syrup and evaporated cane juice but discovered they can be highly glycemic and raise our blood sugar levels just like white sugar. Not good. Next we tried sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol but they can cause intestinal gas and diarrhea. Not nice. Other substances have even been shown to cause cancer in lab animals. Maybe you had the same frustrating experience. Then we were introduced to yacon syrup: it's an all-natural, 100 percent pure, plant-based alternative to sugar, low-glycemic, with a naturally rich taste and documented health benefits such as suppressing hunger and stimulating the bowel with its special fructose called FOS (fructooligosaccharides). With yacon syrup, we found a product we could fall in love with. And we did.

Like a casual Sunday drive, it will leave you relaxed, refreshed, and revitalized without sacrificing any flavor! All of our coffees utilize high grown specialty grade 100% Arabica coffee beans rated to meet or exceed specialty coffee criteria.

This means that you will receive high quality coffee fresher than anything you can get your hands on! We also purchase our beans from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms. You will experience an incredibly fresh roast profile with an aromatic coffee smell and a rich but smooth flavor that is not bitter. We hope you enjoy drinking it as much as we enjoy creating it!

Erased by the progress of modern development, the narrow lane called Verena Street now survives only in our memories.

Or theyll use FORTO as their second cup in the late morning or early afternoon in order to stay energized and get more done throughout the day.</br></br> FORTO is made from real organic cold brewed Colombian coffee.

"['The Coconut Secret Story, a true family story. When the founders of Coconut Secret learned their parents were diabetic, they began with a heartfelt desire to create an organic, low glycemic, gluten-free product line for diabetics. And that is precisely what happened! Hence the birth of the Original Coconut Aminos Soy-Free Seasoning Sauce. Leslie and Randy, founders, were rewarded and blessed beyond expectations, in their discovery of traditional products made from the sap of the wondrous coconut tree. Hence, the creation of an extensive line of coconut-based products to satisfy (and satiate!) virtually every kind of craving. Their focus was to produce a product line that was not ""processed"" to eliminate the majority of naturally occurring nutrients and enzymes. They understood the importance for a healthy body to have naturally occurring nutrients and enzymes present allowing the body to naturally digest and utilize it nutritionally. These holistic values are critical to diabetics, and anyone who wants to build a healthier body. A holistic approach, coconut sugar is made by collecting the ""sap"" from the coconut tree blossoms. Bamboo containers are used to collect the sap of the coconut trees right at the blossoms. When the coconut trees are tapped, they produce a continuously flowing ""inflorescence"" (sap) that exudes from the coconut blossoms. This naturally sweet sap is very low glycemic (GI of 35), raw and enzymatically alive, an abundant source of 17 amino acids, minerals, vitamin C, broad-spectrum B vitamins, and has a nearly neutral pH. It is then minimally evaporated at low temperatures (only to remove excess moisture), never exceeding an average summer day in the tropics. The end result is a syrup-like product known as coconut ""toddy"" which is used to create an awesome tasting and healthy coconut sugar. Coconut Aminos Sauce is USDA Organic certified, soy-free, 100% Organic, Certified (GF) Gluten-Free, Non-GMO, No MSG, Vegan and tastes great.', 'Organic coconut tree sap aged and sun dried with mineral-rich sea salt', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",Coconut Secret Coconut Aminos Sauce Organic 8 oz (1 Pack),['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Zsv9iJs0L._SS40_.jpg'],Coconut Secret,8.99,B019QR8MQQ

Stur was born while my wife was pregnant with our twin girls. The doctor had recommended she drink 8-10 glasses of water a day. But like most Americans, she wasn\'t drinking even half of that! So I started looking for healthy ways to flavor her water. I went to the store and searched the drink mixes, but found that they were all made with artificial chemicals that we didn\'t feel comfortable putting in my wife\'s body. Finally I asked a food scientist friend to help me create a liquid blend of natural fruit flavors and natural stevia leaf extract to squeeze in water.

I called our special blend ""Stur"" and proudly wrote on our hand-drawn label that it had 0 calories, 0 sugar, essential vitamins, and NO artificial sweeteners, colors or flavors.

"['Pure Monk (Monk Fruit or Lou Han Guo) powder is a 100% pure, all-natural, virtually no-calorie sugar substitute, derived from the goodness of real fruit. Monk Fruit is a natural, healthy, Keto safe, flavorful alternative to table sugar and unhealthy chemical sweeteners such as aspartame. Monk fruit has been used for hundreds of years as a natural sweetener and as a traditional medicine in Eastern cultures, monk fruit extract is derived from a small, subtropical Asian melon. Also known as lo han guo, this fruit extract delivers a clean, sweet flavor, with no aftertaste. No wonder its been used in its native China for hundreds of years!<br><br>On A Diet? No Problem this is, gluten free, Paleo, Keto, diabetic safe, and delicious!!<br><br>About Julian Bakerys Pure Monk<br><br>Monk fruit extract is potentabout 100-250 times more intense than table sugar. So, you wont need much, which saves you money!<br>Pure Monk is a 100% pure extract powder. This is important since many commercially marketed lo han guo-based sweeteners blend monk fruit with unhealthy fillers or sugars, such as such as dextrose (which is a corn-derived carbohydratenot good!), sugar (yes, actual sugar!) or molasses.<br><br>How to Use Pure Monk<br><br>You can blend Pure Monk powder directly into liquid, or sprinkle it over any food that needs an extra blast of sweetness. Its simple to use, and fits perfectly into a Paleo lifestyle! <br>But remember, its more intense than regular sugar. In fact, most people find you only need one gram of monk fruit extract to create the same sweet taste as eight teaspoons of sugar.<br>Monk fruit extract has a mildly fruit aroma and dissolves fully in water, making it the perfect way to enhance coffee, tea or protein shakes. Try just a tiny bit at first, since its so sweet! After a bit of trial-and-error, it will be easy to determine how much you need to sweeten your favorite smoothie or drink.<br>Or, use it in place of sugar or maple syrup. Try Pure Monk over Paleo-friendly pancakes, French toast, or in baked goodsmonk fruit extract is heat-stable and fine for baking! Again, experiment with very small quantities of monk fruit extract at first, to ensure you get the sweetness you want without overdoing it. <br>You may also see monk fruit extract in sugar-free and no-sugar-added foods, such as Paleo Cookies. Look for it on the label of your favorite Paleo foods!<br><br>Pure Monk and your Health<br><br>Monk fruit has been used as a traditional medicine in China for hundreds of years.

Imagine snacking on peanut butter thats about one-third the calories and 87% less fat compared to traditional peanut butter (when prepared as directed).
